# Targets pipeline v0.1.5

This project is a targets pipeline. It was made using a [template](https://github.com/adha-rex/targets-template).
The template can be loaded using the following code:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("https://tinyurl.com/get-proj")
get_project(
  project_dir = "YOUR_NEW_PROJECT_DIR", # includes project name and doesn't currently exist i.e. "Projects/new-targets-project"
  repo = "RWParsons/targets-template" # can be in the form "{owner}/{repo}" or just "{repo}" if you are the owner
)
```

To get started with the new project and add it to GitHub, open the project and run the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_git()
usethis::use_github(private = TRUE)
```
